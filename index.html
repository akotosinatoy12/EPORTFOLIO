            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p> Hello! My name is Sophia Marielle S. Escobar and I am a 9th grade student in Las Pinas City National Science Highschool. I am currently 14 years old, and my birthday is on September 14, 2009, making me a virgo. My hobbies are drawing, painting, digital arts, cooking, and baking. I am the eldest in my family because I have one brother. My strengths are: I am good at anything when motivated, I don't take things to heart, and I don't give up no matter how hard the situation is. My weaknesses are: I get demotivated easily, I struggle with constant insecurity and self-consciousness, I get down easily when something bad happens, and most of all, doing mathematics. My dreams are travelling the world, specifically Switzerland and Northern Italy, and the course and job I want to take, I'm still undecided. As long as it's a good paying job, anything works for me. </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> This 1st quarter, it was a time of transitioning. I met a lot of new faces, each with distinctive personlity. I also met a lot of new teachers, and they were so good at teaching! I heard that grade 9 is the hardest in Junior Highschool, and I can say, yes it is. Compared to 8th Grade, mas pressuring and mas maraming ginagawa sa Grade 9. It's like, sumeryoso bigla yung school year. Kaya I had a bit of hard time because I had a little trouble in keeping up sa mga gawain. I'm not sure but this school year talaga, I became more prone to cramming. I want to try and fix it next quarter. In ICT, there were a lot of new lessons, because I'm used to the basic lessons like "Microsoft" and basic HTML. But my mind has been opened to a lot of new knowledge in this subject. Nahirapan lang talaga ako sa mga on the spot hands-on because it's very time pressuring and minsan nakakalimutan ko kung ano yung mga tamang codes. Overall, 1st quarter was a little hard for me. But I expect 2nd quarter to be much harder in the future. </p>
