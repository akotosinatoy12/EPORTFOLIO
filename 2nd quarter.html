            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p> Hello again! My name is Sophia Marielle S. Escobar and I am a 9th grade student in Las Pinas City National Science Highschool. I am currently 15 years old, and my birthday is on September 14, 2009, making me a virgo. My hobbies are still drawing, painting, digital arts, cooking, and baking. I am the eldest in my family because I have one brother. My strengths are: I am good at anything when motivated, I don't take things to heart, and I don't give up no matter how hard the situation is. My weaknesses are: I get demotivated easily, I struggle with constant insecurity and self-consciousness, I get down easily when something bad happens, and most of all, doing mathematics. My dreams are travelling the world, specifically Switzerland and Northern Italy, and the course and job I want to take, I'm still undecided. As long as it's a good paying job, anything works for me. </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> This 2nd quarter, medyo okay-okay na. We did a lot of things in other subjects, and there were many events too. Medyo humihirap na rin yung mga lessons. Compared last quarter, mas mahirap 'to. Pero syempre, mas mahirap next quarter. I can't believe it, honestly. It's already 3rd quarter next month. Ang bilis ng oras. If I'm going to reflect on my performance this quarter, I think I became a little worse. I lost motivation in academics, like nagiging tamad na ako sa mga gagawin. Hindi ko nabawasan yung pag-cramming ko, and sometimes, I do my work at school na rin. Hindi naman ako ganito dati eh. Bumaba din yung mga test scores ko, kasi if I'm going to be honest, tinutulugan ko nalang yung pag review sa mga tests. I don't have anyone to blame, but myself. This quarter, I guess my mental health affected my academic performance, that's why I wasn't doing so well  this quarter. But of course, babawi ako sa susunod na quarter. I won't try, I will do it. 2 more quarters left, kahit isang honors this school year, okay na ako. In ICT naman, I learned a lot about CSS, because this quarter, we are introduced to CSS na. I learned that there is linked CSS, where you have to make a seperate file to design your web page. It's a bit complicated, but if you learn and practice, you'll get the hang of it. This is all for my reflection, thank you! </p>
